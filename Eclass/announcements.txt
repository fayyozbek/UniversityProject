Kirti Seth|Exams|This is a short explanation about the "final note" seen in the last 'lecture' in week 15. In other words, what is the meaning of the following writing: ************************************************************ At the end of the Final Assignment you are going to see the following important NOTE! If you got any help, intentionally or unintentionally, when you were solving this final assignment, then you have to explain: (i) who provided the help, and (ii) what is the nature of the help that you obtained  just write down a short explanation. If this is not the case with you then at the end of your final assignment you can simply write: Help NA |
